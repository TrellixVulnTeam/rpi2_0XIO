    <!--
        Altitude:

        Description:

        A human-readable description of the location, if available.

        WARNING: Applications should not rely on this property since not all
        sources provide a description. If you really need a description (or
        more details) about current location, use a reverse-geocoding API, e.g
        geocode-glib.
